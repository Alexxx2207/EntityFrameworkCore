<h1>Entity Relations</h1>

There are two projects that create 2 databases for Football Betting System and Student System using Code-First approach with Entity Framework Core.
 - I have used Fluent API and data annotation attributes to control the process of creating the databases.

<strong>You should insert your connection string's parameters for your database in ConnectionString.ini!</strong>
